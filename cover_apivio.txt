RE: Full-time Software Engineer

Dear Hiring Manager,

This letter is to express my interest in your posting for full time Software
Engineer.  With a Bachelor’s degree in Technology in
Computer Sciences and Engineering and ten plus years of international
experience in developing, enhancing, and maintaining complex projects
using C language in areas such as device driver, Edge router, Industrial
firewall and Digital Switching System, I am confident that I will be an asset to
Apivio research and development team.

My background includes extensive 'C' programming experience in Real-time
operating system and embedded environment using the Waterfall as well as
Agile methodologies conforming to ISO:9001 and CMM standards as
following:

Most recently while working with GE digital, I enhanced and maintained
Linux based firewall software through writing packet sniffer for
industrial space, hardening Deep Packet Inspection (DPI Engine) code and
strengthening the standard protocol to avoid potential evasions and
vulnerabilities.

During my tenure with Ericsson Canada, I specialized in development of
large scale embedded software in B-RAS (Broadband Remote Access Server)
which included, migrating UNIX applications from 32-bit IBM Power PC
platform to 64-bit Broadcom MIPS processor for next generation
controlled card.

While working with Lucent Technologies and Center for Development of
Telematics (C-Dot), I developed expertise in UNIX kernel code in areas
such as writing device driver, defect fixing in complex multi-processor
kernel (Single Instruction Multiple Data), feature augmentations and
performance enhancements in UNIX SVR2.0 code base.

In conclusion, I am confident that with my experiences in developing
within UNIX environment and familiarity with the Software development
life cycle alongside my strong communication skills and my ability to
prioritize and work multiple projects will allow me to thrive with Apivio.
Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Sushil Agarwal

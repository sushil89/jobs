Various phases of compilation:
 
1. Lexical Analysis: this phase will read the input file and grouped the
logically belong together characters into tokens such as identifier, key
word, delimiters, constant etc. Each token has two attributes: Type and
Value. During this phase tokens are also inserted in symbol table. Tool
used to perform lexical analysis are 'lex'.
regular expressions -->lex-->lex.yy.c--->cc-->a.out
input src file -->a.out--> tokens ----can be feed to parser.
 
2. Syntax Analysis: This phase will check that tokens are as per grammer
rules and generates a parse tree later used by next phase of compiler to
generate intermediate code. Tools used is 'yacc', this used LALR(1)
parser. One can specify rules to resolve shift/reduce and reduce/reduce
conflicts.
 
3. Intermediate code generation: take parse tree and generate sequence of
instructions in some intermediate language.
 
4. Optimization (optional phase): various method like local optimization,
constant unfolding: replacing runtime computation by compile time,
 
Loop optimization: such as moving loop invarient computation to begning of
lp, loop unrolling, loop jaming.
 
Peephole optimization: such as removing extra load/store operation,
removing multiple jump: goto L1, L1: goto L2,
removing unnecessary operations such as x=x*1, x=x*0, x=x+0 etc.
 
Reduction in strength: replace expensive operation by equivalent non expen
sive one such as replacing multiply/divide by power of 2 by shift
operation.
 
5. Code generation: convert intrmdt code to target language.
 
How to bootstrap first new compiler: Suppose we have to write compiler for
new language 'L' on m/c A and B. First write a small compiler that
translate
subset of 'L' into machine language of A. We can write this compiler in any
language which is available on m/c A say assembly language of A. Now using
this compiler and subset of language L we can write the compiler of
language
'L'.
 
r(ight-hand-side)-value and l(eft-hand-side)-value:
For identifier r-value is value stored in identifier and l-value is
location where value is stored. Ex
int b, a = 5; so r-value of a is 5 and l-value is address of a.
 
b = a; so r-value of a is assigned in l-value of b.
 
 
Parameter passing:
Call by value : r-value of param is passeed to fn. 'C' used this.
Call by reference: l-value of param is passed to fn e.x. VAR in PASCAL, reference type
in C++
 
 
 
ANSI fn prototype
 
#ifdef __STDC__
int fn(int, int);
#else
int fn();
#endif
 
OR
 
#if defined(__STDC__) || defined(__cplusplus)
# ifndef _PROTOTYPES

# endif /* _PROTOTYPES */
#endif /* __STDC__ || __cplusplus */
 
#if defined(_PROTOTYPES)
#define __(arg) arg

Some tricky ones
================
1. EXOR
 
a ^ b = ~a.b + a.~b where ^ is EXOR, ~ is NOT, . is AND and + is OR
a^0 = a
a^1 = ~a /* this can be used to invert any bit */
a^a = 0 /* this can be used to reset */
(a^b)^a = b
(a^b)^b = a
So how to swap two varaibles w/t temporary variable
a = a^b
b = a^b /* since a is a^b so a^b^b ==> a */
 
* Function pointer
Declare a pointer to function
int (*fun_ptr)(int, int)
 
Assign an address to function ptr
int some_fun(int, int);
fun_ptr = some_fun; //short form
fun_Ptr = &some_fun; // long form
 
Comapring the function pointer
if (fun_ptr == &some_fun) ...
 
Calling function using function pointer
fun_ptr(a, b); // short form
(*fun_ptr)(a, b); //Long form
 
How to pass a function ptr as an argument
int some_function(int (*fun_ptr_as_arg)(int, int), ...)
typedef int (*FUN_PTR)(int, int)
int some_function (FUN_PTR, ...)
 
How to dacl function returning pointer to a function taking
one int type argument and returning float
float (*some_function(double, ..))(int);
Or
typedef float (*FUN_PTR)(int);
FUN_PTR some_function(double, ...);
 
a = a^b /* since a is a^b and now b is a coz of previous step so
(a^b)^a==>b */
 
* Decl an array of N pointers to function returning
pointers to functions returning pointers to characters?
 
char *(*(*a[N])())();
OR
typedef char *pc /* pointer to char */
typedef pc fpc(); /* function returning pointer to char */
typedef fpc *pfpc; /* pointer to above */
typedef pfpc fpfpc(); /* function returning ... */
typedef fpfpc *pfpfpc; /* pointer to ... */
typedef pfpfpc a[N]; /* array of ... */
 
* How to decl fn prototype taking variable arguments
These are called variadic (variable adicity/rank/type).
 
Function that take the variable number of arguments
must have at least one formal parameter.
 
Why we need variadic functions:
In some cases a function can handle any number of values by operating on
all of them as a block. For example, consider a function that allocates a
one-dimensional array with malloc to hold a specified set of values.
This operation makes sense for any number of values, as long as the
length of the array corresponds to that number.
Without facilities for variable arguments, you would have to define
a separate function for each possible array size.
 
 
E.g. int sum(int x, ...)
here ellipsis tells compiler to allow zero or more arguments
of any type.
 
#include <stdarg.h>
va_list arg_p;
 
va_start(arg_p, last_formal_param)
lval_type = va_arg(arg_p, type) /* type could be int, double etc. */
va_end(arg_p)
 
Sample example
1)
 
int sum(int a, b, c, num_of_optional_param, ...) {
va_list arg_ptr; int i, total;
va_start(arg_ptr, num_of_optional_param);
for(i=0; i<num_of_optional_param, i++)
total += va_arg(arg_ptr, int);
va_end(arg_ptr);
}
In above example I assume that all of optional params are
"int" type. If that is not the case one has to pass the
format_string as last formal param and function will
scan the type stored in format string and then call
va_arg with appropriate type.
 
2) Another example is using vprintf
 
int myprintf(const char *fmt_string, ...) {
va_list arg_ptr;
 
va_start(arg_ptr, fmt_string);
vprintf(fmt_string, arg_ptr)
va_end(arg_ptr);
}
 
3) Another way is to use macro supporting
variable number of args.
 
#define myprintf(a, b, c, rest...) \
printf(fmt_string, ##rest);
 
4)
int *allocate(num, ...) {
va_list arg_ptr;
int_ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)*num);
va_start(arg_ptr, num);
for (i=0; i<num; i++)
*(int_ptr+i) = va_arg(arg_ptr, int);
 
va_end(arg_ptr);
return(int_ptr);
}
 
* How to decl pointer to constant data type
const data-type *pointer-name
You can change the pointer but not content of pointer.
 
* How to decl constant pointer to data type
data-type *const pointer-name = &same-data-type-name;
You can't change the pointer but can change the content of pointer.
 
* Read the following decl
const int * &i;
from right to left, i is reference to a pointer to a constant integer.
 
*How to invert nth (say 10th) bit in given bit-pattern
EXOR the given bit-pattern with 2 to-the-power 10 (a^1 = ~a)
 
* How to reset n'th bit
So we need to find a mask in witch all bit are 1 except n'th
bit and then AND this mask with given bit-pattern to
reset it.
 
Now how to find such mask!
The mask will looks like 1111101111
just invert this 0000010000
So, we can make inver of such mask by shift.
And then invert it to get the mask.
 
Thus to invert n'th bit mask will be ~(1<<n)
 
var = var & mask
 
* Write non-looping C expression to find out given number
is power of 2.
 
if x&(-x) == x then x is power of 2
however this also identify 0 as power of 2 so to eleminate that
check if ((x&(-x)) == x) && x) then x is power of 2
 
* How to increment a int variable without using ++.
use var = var +1 :)
OR
var = -(~var) because -(~var) is ~~var +1 => var+1 assuming
negative numbers are represented by 2's complement method.
OR
cast var to pointer to char, index to 2nd element of this i.e [1]
and cast it back to integer. (int) &( ((char *)var)[1] )
OR
struct foo { char a, b};
(int) &( ((struct foo *)var)->b )
 
* What is Parity: way to detect error in transmission.
Odd Parity: parity bit is set if number of 1's are odd. Use exor to compute this
Even Parity Parity bit is set if number of 1's are even.
 
*In link list node struct, suggest any alternate way to store next field
Suppose we knew the address of Header, so exor the next node address with
header address and store in next field. To Generate the next node, exor
this next field again with header address
(Header_Address ^ Node_Address) ^ Header_Address ===> Node_address
 
 
* What kind fns can't be make inline?
recursive or if taking address of function.
function is not small
?? If function using static variable.
 
* Basic data type in C are
int (natural m/c word),
float (floating point),
double (double precision floating point)
 
Type specifier is short and long,
 
Type qualifier is const and volatile
 
So long long >= long int >= int >= short int
and long double (extra precision) >= double >= float
(double is same as long float but "long float" is not used
and there is no short float)
 
* use of volatile
- Use volatile type qualifier for objects of automatic storage duration
that are modified between setjmp() and longjmp().
E.g.,
some_function()
{
int v;
jmp_buf buf;
 
v = 3;
 
if (setjmp(buf)) {
printf("val is %d\n", v);
return;
}
 
// compiler may optimized this as v is not being used after this point!
// and printf will print 3 which is wrong.
// Use volatile to avoid the problem.
v = 10;
longjmp(buf, 1);
 
}
 
- When writing driver code, use volatile for memory mapped var
to avoid possible compilation obtimization.
 
* printf %[-][width][.precision]X
- is for left justification
 
width these many spaces will be made available for the the object.
Infact this is the minimum width, if object need more space
it will spill out of this space.
 
.precision this has different meaning for different formatting character(X)
For floating point, this indicates the number of digits printed
after the decimal. For string, this will specify the maximum
characters to be printed.

* Give example of operator overloading in C
"*" multiplication and content of address
"&" Bit wise AND and address
"-" binary subtraction and unary negation
"." member of and decimal
 
* Examples of compile time operators
sizeof, +, -, * etc.
 
* Operator precedence and associativity
Precedence - relative priority of operator
Associativity - order of evaluation when multiple operators are combined.
 
Typically binary operators have left to right or left associativity
(exception are = += -= *= /= <<= >>= |= &= ^= are right associative)
 
The typical unary operators are right to left or right associative
 
For example + and - have the same precedence, so how do we evaluate the following?
 
z = y-2+x;
 
We know that + and - associate the left to right, this function is the same as z=(y-2)+x;.
Meaning the subtraction is performed first because it is more to the left than the addition.
Most operations associate left to right, but the following table illustrates that some
operators associate right to left
 
Precedence Associativity
 
highest () [] . -> ++(postfix) --(postfix) left to right
 
++(prefix) --(prefix) !~ sizeof(type) +(unary) -(unary) &(address) *(dereference) right to left
 
* / % left to right
+ - left to right
<< >> left to right
< <= > >= left to right
== != left to right
& left to right
^ left to right
| left to right
&& left to right
|| left to right
 
? : right to left
 
= += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= |= &= ^= right to left
lowest , left to right
 
Also remember postfix increment such as p++ will increment the p and return the old (before
increment) value.
 
some tricky one
 
1) *p++ will be *(p++) i.e. p is incremented first (as postfix ++ has higher precedence than *),
and then the old value of p is return and that old value is dereferenced by *.
say p is pointer to int, and int with 0xA000 and content of 0xA000 is 5
then *p++ will move the p to 0xA000+4 and also dereferenced the value at 0xA000.
 
2) 1+5&4==3
 
so (1+5) & (4==3)
 
3) a->b.c++
all operators have same precedence, so use associativity which is L->R
So, ((a->b).c)++
 
4) i =2;
    i = i++;
The output is undefined as per ANSI and unspecified as per K&R.
the post increment operator has a side effect, it increment the value of i and return the old value,
so if i is referenced anywhere else in the expression it lead to undefined behavior.
As it depends on compiler to when to store the post increment value --- after evaluation of whole expression/statement or immediately
after post increment.
 
* Arithmetic Conversion
(Rule of thumbs:
1. Lower type is promoted to higher type.
2. If lower type is unsigned and higher type is signed, check if all
values of lower type can be stored in signed higher type. If so
lower type unsigned is promoted to signed. If not both are converted
to unsigned lower type.
3. If two operand are same type, but one is signed and other is unsigned
then both are promoted to unsigned type.
4. Signed values are always sign extended when promoted to larger type
even if resulting type is unsigned.
5. Unsigned values are not sign extended when promoting to larger type.
 
6. Integral promotion rules as per K&R
Conversion of char and short type to int type
unsigned char -> unsigned int
signed char -> signed int
unsigned short-> unsigned int
signed short -> signed int
 
However after publication of K&R a serious divergence has occurred among implementers
of C towards integral promotion rules. One camp support unsigned preserving and
second camp support value preserving.
 
The unsigned preserving is same as what K&R mentioned.
 
The value preserving rule promotes unsigned char and short to signed int,
if signed int can represent all the values of the original type otherwise
unsigned int. Thus if execution env represents short in smaller space than
int then unsigned short will be signed int; otherwise unsigned int.
 
E.g.:
unsigned short a=1;
unsigned long b = (a << 31);
 
PROBLEM: The expected result (and the result from a 32-bit executable) is 0x80000000.
The result generated by a 64-bit executable, however, is 0xffffffff80000000.
 
CAUSE: Why is this sign extended? First, when the shift operator is invoked, the
variable a is promoted to a variable of type int. Because all values of a short
can fit into a signed int, the result of this promotion is signed
(value preserving camp).
 
Second when the shift completed, the result was stored into a long.
Thus, the 32-bit signed value represented by (a << 31) was sign
extended (rule 4) when it was promoted to a 64-bit value
(even though the resulting type is unsigned).
 
SOLUTION: To fix this problem, you should cast a to long prior to the shift.
Thus, the short will be promoted only once---this time, to a 64-bit type
(at least when compiled as a 64-bit executable).
 
Another example
int a=-2;
unsigned int b=1;
long c = a + b;
 
PROBLEM: When executed on a 32-bit architecture, the result is -1 (0xffffffff).
When run on a 64-bit architecture, the result is 4294967295 (0x00000000ffffffff),
which is probably not what you were expecting.
 
CAUSE: Why does this happen? First, the two numbers are added.
A signed value plus an unsigned value results in an unsigned value (rule 3).
Next, that value is promoted to a larger type. This promotion does not
cause sign extension (rule 5).
 
SOLUTION: To fix this in a 32-bit-compatible way, cast b to long.
This forces the non-sign-extended promotion of b to a 64-bit type
prior to the addition, thus forcing the signed integer to be promoted
(in a signed fashion) to match. With that change, the result is the expected -1.

* Doubly link list
How to invert the doubly list - hint just swap the next and previous pts
 
node *current, *temp;
current = head;
 
while(current) {
 
temp = current->next; /* save the next in temp */
current->next = current->prev; /* modify the next field as it is already saved */
current->prev = temp;
 
current = temp;
 
}
/* Re-arrange the head and tail pointers */
current = head;
head = tail;
tail = current;
 
* How to invert the single list
 
node *prev, *current *tmp;
prev = NULL;
current = head;
while (current) {
    head = current;
 
    tmp = current->next;
    current->next = prev;
    prev = current;
 
    current = tmp;
}
 
Recursive version
node *reverse(node *current)
{
if (current->next == NULL)
return current;
temp = reverse(current->next);
tmp->next = current;
return(current);
}
 
*Doubly Circular link list
 
typedef struct node {
node * next;
node * previous;
int info;
} node_t;
 
node_t header;
 
init: header.next = header.previous = &header;
 
add:
new.next = header.next;
new.previous = &header;
header.next.previous = &new;
header.next = &new;
 
Advantage is that no need to take care of any special case
like adding when list is null etc!
 
del:
cur.previous.next = cur.next;
cur.next.previous = cur.previous;
 
Again no need to take care of any special case!
 
*Why Need doubly link list
Addition and Deletion easy, no need to keep extra back pointer.
Error recovery in case one of the pointer got corrupted.
Can do certain audits by moving forward with next link and coming back
with previous field and vice versa!
 
if (cur->next->previous != cur) OR (cur->previous->next != cur)
Panic/Audit Failed
 
One can also start counting elements in first using
"next" pointer and then using "previous" pointer +
some check to avoid infinite loop. The two counts
is same in healthy link list.
 
One can use "node_t" in any structure, to make link
list of such structure. For example
 
typedef some_struct {
node_t list;
other fields...
} s_some_t;
 
LINK_INIT(node_t *list) { list->next = list->prev = list;}
 
When initialize the structure, use
LINK_INIT(&struct_p->list)
 
It is easier if we stuck node_t as first field of
structure, as in this case one can cast "next" field
to struct type to get pointer to structure where
this element is. Other wise, one can write COERCE
macro to get address of base of structure by giving
typedef of struct + field name and pointer. For example
 
#define COERCE(PTR, TYPE, FIELD) \
(TYPE *) ( (UINT32)(PTR) - (UINT32)&( (TYPE *)(NULL)->FIELD ) )
 
So for example, if "list" field is defined as as follows
typedef some_struct {
other fields...
node_t list;
other fields ..
} s_some_t;
 
node_t *ptr;
say ptr = some_struct_ptr->list.next;
while (ptr != &some_struct_ptr->list) {
ptr1 = COERCE(ptr, s_some_t, list);
....
ptr = ptr->next;
}
 
* How to detect cycle in link list
This can be done using Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm.
It is also called the "tortoise and the hare" algorithm.
 
slow_ptr = fast_ptr = head;
cycle = 1;
 
do {
 
if (fast_ptr->next) {
    fast_ptr = fast_ptr->next->next;
    slow = slow ->next;
}
else
     cycle = 0;
} while ((cycle) && (slow_ptr != fast_ptr));
 
Also check http://blog.ostermiller.org/find-loop-singly-linked-list for good discussion of the problem.
 
* Big Endian Vs Little Endian
Big Endian most significant byte is stored at lowest address
Processors supporting big endian are Motorola
Advantage is in networking as MSB can carry routing info
also one can read sign bit in first byte if using assembly.
 
Little Endian MSB in highest address, Processor using are Intel.
Advantage is that reading word is easier i.e. add+0 most significant byte
add+1 least significant byte ..
 
* How to find out endianness of a machine
typedef enum { FALSE=0, TRUE} BOOL;
BOOL isBigEndian()
{
unsigned int x = 0xAB; //0x000000AB in Big Endian, 0xAB000000 in little
 
return (((char *)&x)[0] == 0xAB) ? 0:1);
}
*How to Convert big endian word(int) to little endian
#define SWAP_LONG(x) \
( ((unsigned int)(x) << 24) | \
(((unsigned int)(x) & 0xff00) << 8) | \

( ((unsigned short)(x) << 8) | \
((unsigned short)(x) >> 8))
#define SWAP_SHORT(x) \

Things to remember
When shifting right, sign bit got filled in i.e. 0xAABB shifting it by
8 bits to right, sign bit(1) got filled in and it become FFAA so to avoid
this either cast the original number to unsigned and then perform the shift
or mask the bits after right shift.
 
How to swap all the bits in a byte (12345678 to 87654321)

* Fn to allocate memory (related to pointers)
int getbuf(void **aof_ptr, int size)
{
void *tmp_ptr;
 
if (tmp_ptr = malloc(size)) {
*aof_ptr = tmp_ptr;
return(0);
}
 
return(1); /* error */
}
 
void freebuf(void **aof_ptr)
{
free(*aof_ptr);
*aof_ptr = NULL;
return;
}
 
We must pass address of pointer in both the above fn as we are
modifying the pointer itself!
 
* What is the difference b/w heap and stack
* How to represent -ive numbers
 
Negative numbers are represented by 2's complement method i.e.
Take 1's complement and add 1
Example: To get -1 take 2's complement of 1
1 === 0x00000001
1's complement === 0xfffffffe
Add 1 === 0xffffffff
 
* What is reentrant code
non self modifying code. This is also known as thread safe code.
Pure code/text i.e. function should not use any global data which
also include static data. If can't avoid use of global data then
protect it with lock/semaphore or raise the processor priority to
maintain the data consistency.
 
Also, function should not returns static variables (covered by
not using static var in first paragraph). Example of non-reentrant
functions are strtok as it holds the string to be broken into
tokens. Another example is ctime it returns pointer to a static
data that is overwritten by each call.
 
Function returning static var should be modifed by following two
ways 1) Dynamically allocate space and return that
2) Caller of function passes the space where value can be returned.
 
There are thread safe version of C lib available with _r suffix
such as strtok_r etc.
 
A crude way to find if a given lib is thread safe or not is as follows
1. write a test program invoking functions in library
2. stub out the library functions
3. compile and check the data/bss size using size on a.out
4. remove the stubs and compile the test program with lib
5. again check the size of data and bss sections, if they increased that means
that lib is using global data and hence lib is not thread safe.
I am not sure if this way one can catch use of static var too.
 
 
 
* CISC(complex instruction set computer) Vs RISC(reduced inst set computer)
time/program = instructions/program * cycle/instruction * time/cycle
CISC - Vertical(complex) instruction decoding, time consuming
generated code size is less in comparison to RISC but
since each inst take more time the overall time is more.
These complex instructions are further divided into microcodes
and HW having control units to decode these microcodes.
Thus complexcity is shifted from SW to HW. Most of CISC
instructions need more than one cycle to execute.
 
(history: during late 70s, core memory use to be very expencive
and secondary memory was very slow, so idea behind CISC to
reduced the generated code so it take less space
when loaded in core memory, hence they designed complex
instructions and addressing schemes, so that one can map
HLL to Assembly one to one. )
 
So to keep time/program minimum, CISC focused on first
factor(inst/program).
 
RISC - Horizantal instruction decoding, simple store/load inst
used many registers, Assembly code size is much more
in comparison to CISC but they are consist of simple
instruction hence overall execution time is less.
RISC compilers are more complex than that of CISC.
RISC don't use microcodes and most of the instructions
need just one cpu cycle to complete. This helps to build
pipelines.
 
So to keep time/program minimum, RISC focused on second
factor(cycle/instruction). Thuogh number of instructions
generated are little bit more compair to CISC code but
since each inst. take only one cpu cycle hence overall
better time/program.
 
* Dos and don't while writing ISR
1. Don't use any blocking(malloc, semaphore/lock which may endup
calling sleep )function inside ISR. This has three side effects
a. This will unnecessarly penalise current process by putting
it to sleep state.
 
b. Before going to sleep, ISR might has acquired some critical
resources so those critical resources are held up.
 
c. Last but not least this block all interrupts coming at same
and lesser interrupt priority level and causing higher interrupt
lattency.
 
2. If ISR acquiring any lock/semaphore/resource, which can also be
acquired by any higher level ISR then block that higher priority
interrupt b/f acquiring the resource.
 
3. Try to make it short to avoid high interrupt latency in low
priority interrupts.
 
* Define what is recursive procedures are and why u should not use
recursion in OS code.
 
A procedure which call itself e.g. factorial number, tree traversal
Inorder(Left-Root-Right),Preorder(Right-Root-Left)and Postorder(Left-Right-Root)
GNU(GNU is Not Unix)
 
In general, recursion is used to divide the given problem in
smaller sub-problem until the problem is small enough to be
solved and then based on this try to solve bigger problem.
This is top-down programing approach (see dynamic programing
which is bottom-up). One disadvantage of top-down approach is
some time same sub problem is solved multiple times classic
example is Fibonacci numbers.
 
Recursion permits lucid and concise description of algorithms(easier
to understand), w/t recursion one have to use stack. However recursion
usages run time stack!
 
In OS one should avoid recusion because recursion need lot of run
time stack space so if problem is very large, it can overflow the
stack area and lead data corruption.
 
More facts about recursion:
 
Direct recursion Vs. indirect
-----------------------------
If function call itself then it is direct recursion.
If say function A call function B and B call function A, this is indirect recursion.
 
Tail Recursion
---------------
A function is said to be tail recursive, if there is no pending operation
to be performed after return from recursion.
Tail recursive function typically returns the value of last recursive
call as the value of the function.
 
The tail recursion is very desirable because they saved lot of stack space
during run time (stack space is independent of number of recursive calls).
 
The infamous factorial is usually written in a non-tail recursive manner
 
int fact (int)
{
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;
   
    return ( n * fact(n-1) );
}
 
Here pending operation multiplication to be performed after
return from recursion. whenever there is a pending operation, the
function is non-tail recursive and information
about each pending operation has to be stored so the amount of
information is not independent of the number of calls.
 
The factorial can be written in a tail-recursive way:
 
int fact (n)
{
     return (fact_aux(n, 1));
}
 
int fact_aux(number, accumulator)
{
    if (number == 0)
  	   return(accumulator);
 
    return (fact_aux(number-1, number * accumulator));
}
 
Linear Vs non-linear (tree) recursion
-------------------------------------
The way recursion grows.
If pending operations involve no other recursive call then it is linear recursion.
A function is called non-linear recursive if pending operation involve another
recursive call.
The Fibonacci function is classic example of tree recursion.
 
fib(n) = 0 if n is 0
= 1 if n is 1
= fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
 
* Fibonacci numbers
 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
 
For general definition, see above
Problem with recursive solution is that we need to recompute
the same numbers for multiple times.
 
So, either use tail recursion for use iterative solution.
 
Iterative solution:
unsigned int fibonacci(unsigned int n)
{
    if (n == 0)
        return 0;
    if ((n == 1) || (n == 2))
        return 1;
 
    for (i=3; i<n; i++) {
        tmp = prev;
        prev += prev_prev;
        prev_prev = tmp;
    }
 
    return(prev);
 
}
 
Using Tail recursion:
/* Find out the nth number in fibonacci series
 * which is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …
 */
 
int fab(int n)
{
    if (n == 1)
        return 0;
    if (n == 2)
   return 1;
 
    
    return(fab_aux(n, 1, 0));
}
 
int fab_aux(int n, prev, prev_prev)
{
    if (n == 2)
        return prev;
 
    return(fab_aux(n-1, prev+prev_prev, prev));
}
 
* Recursive Vs. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic progamming is bottom-up approach i.e. first solve the trivial cases
store the result. add the complexcity to trivial problem and try to solve
it based on previous result and the store the result to next step.
Thus it require lots of memory space to store the intermediate results.
 
However, unlike recursion, it save time by avoid solving the same
sub-problem by using intermediate results.
 
One variation of bottom-up approach is letting recursive solution to
store the intermediate results and thus avoid solving the same sub-problem
repeatedly! This approach is called Memorization.
 
* What is portable code?
1. Using wrappers around system calls e.g. using vertual system call
then within virtual system call try to keep platform dependencies
at single place/file.
Example: say one system support bcopy and another support only memcpy
so it better to write wrapper function such as say projectname_cpy
and call either bcopy or memcpy inside this wrapper.
 
2. Don't make any assumption on size of char, int, long, short etc. Use S8,
S16, S32 and typedef (e.g. typedef int S32). Keep this environment
dependent info in single file and include this file.
 
Also data types may be aligned to different word boundaries
so compiler can introduce fillers.
 
3.Don't hard code ASCII char in C code as well as shell scripts
'\012' instead of '\n'
 
Don't use char as indices into array
hash_table['a'] may not equal to hash_table[0x41] is
character set is EBCDIC.
 
Don't use high order bit of char for some special purpose.
one can do this in ASCII as only 7bits are necessary for
all printable characters but this is not true in EBCDIC.
 
Don't assume that character set('a'..'z') is contiguous.
This is true for ASCII but not in EBCDIC. Even seemingly
harmless code need to be change
char c; for (c='a'; c<'z'; c++) {..}
 
When writing code on EBCDIC m/c which talk to
arbitrary remote system via socket (such as FTP client)
then always convert text to ASCII b/f sending
and convert incoming text to EBCDIC.
 
4. Check code generated by lex and yacc as they
contains ASCII dependencies and won't work in
EBCDIC system.
 
5. Don't make any assumption on endianness of m/c.
6. stay away from non portable packages eg cursore
7. try to avoid use of shared memory and signals.
 
If u endup porting s/w, try to list all system calls used
(run nm to list all fn calls) and see if destination platform is
POSIX or XPG compliant (yu job is very easy). If not list all
system call and their params and match in the destination platform.
 
* Some good programming tricks
create environment option file, having following sections
o common flags such as debug/trace level
o product specific such as protocol variant ITU, ANS, NTT, product
features and coupling etc.
 
create environment dependent file, having following sections

* How is 64bit application more useful than 32bit
* What is Real time OS
* Name Real time OS pSoS, VxWorks, MTOS
* what is priority inversion ( Let high priority job wait and allow
low priority job to finish and free the resource for high priority job)
 
* What are advantages of using Network Processors
1. Unlike ASIC, NPU are programable so easily cope with changing technologies.
2. Unlike General Perpose CPUs, they are optimized for packet processing
such as pattern matching, Hash lookup and Content Addressable Memory
3. No MMU overhead, this helps to keep up to line speed.
4. H/W supported multithreading. Zero or few cycle required for context switch
 
* Mapping line rate to packet processing speed
Line Rate(bits/sec) -> packet/sec (say a)
CPU speed (cycle/sec) (say b)
so b/a is cycle/packet
 
ex: data rate is oc-48 i.e. 2.5 Gbps so system should be able to keep up
with min size packets at this rate
Min size packet = 46Bytes
packet arrival rate 2.5/(46*8) = 6.8 Million Packets/sec
CPU speed is 600 MHz = 600 Million cycle/sec
so 600/6.8 = 88 cycle/packet
 
* B-tree - check notes at http://web.umr.edu/~ercal/253/253.html
for constructing b-tree from traversal sequence
 
To exactley construct the binary search tree, we should
traverse it in preorder or level order and then add the
nodes as per the traversal sequence.
Remember, we built the tree from top down i.e. nodes are always added
as leaves. Therefore, in order to reconstuct the exactly same binary search tree
following property must hold - before a key is inserted into the tree, the key which
was the key of its parent node in the original tree must already be in the tree.
Preorder or level-order traversal will do what we need, since each always visits
parents before their children, and so parents will always appear before their children
 
* B-tree
keys in a binary search tree are stored such that
all nodes in the right subtree must be greater than or equal to root
and all nodes in the left subtree must be less than or equal to root.
operation on binary search tree are
Tree walk - Inorder, Preorder, PostOrder and Level order (Bredth-first)
Inorder - left, root, right (need operator precedence to parse the traversal seq.)
Preorder - root, left, right (polish notation, non-ambiguous, can use to copy search tree)
To copy the binary search tree, traverse the original tree in preorder and
add the node in new tree.
 
Postorder - left, right, root (easy to parse postfix traversal sequence)
 
inorder_tree_walk(tree *root)
if (root != NULL) {
inorder_tree_walk(root->left)
printf("key is %d\n", root->key);
inorder_tree_walk(root->right);
}
 
Level Order
Let t be the tree root.
while (t != null)
{
visit t and put its children on a FIFO queue;
remove a node from the FIFO queue and
call it t;
// remove returns null when queue is empty
}
a
b c
d e f
g h i j
 
a b c d e f g h i j

* Find lowest common ancestor in binary search tree
From wikipedia the definition of lca is
In graph theory and computer science, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself (so if v has a direct connection from w, w is the lowest common ancestor). In a tree, the lowest common ancestor is unique; in DAGs, this is not necessarily the case.
 
tree *find_lca_in_bst(tree *root, int a, int b)
{
    if (!root)
        return (NULL);
 
    if (a<root->val && root->val >b) ||
       (a>root->val && root->val>b)
           return(root);
 
/* Since each node is descendant of itself */   
 if (root->val == a) ||
       (root->val == b)
            return (root);
 
if (root->val > a && root->val > b)
    return (find_lca_in_bst(root->left, a, b));
 
return(find_lca_in_bst(root->right, a, b));
 
} /*find_lca_in_bst */
 
* Find lca in binary tree
// This function returns pointer to LCA of two given values n1 and n2.
// This function assumes that n1 and n2 are present in Binary Tree

{
    // Base case
    if (root == NULL) return NULL;
 
    // If either n1 or n2 matches with root's key, report
    // the presence by returning root (Note that if a key is
    // ancestor of other, then the ancestor key becomes LCA
    if (root->key == n1 || root->key == n2)
        return root;
 
    // Look for keys in left and right subtrees
    Node *left_lca  = findLCA(root->left, n1, n2);
    Node *right_lca = findLCA(root->right, n1, n2);
 
    // If both of the above calls return Non-NULL, then one key
    // is present in once subtree and other is present in other,
    // So the current node is the LCA
    if (left_lca && right_lca)  return root;
 
    // Otherwise check if left subtree or right subtree is LCA
    return (left_lca != NULL)? left_lca: right_lca;
}
 
 
* How to manage free buffer in a pool
Use rings to manage the buffers in a free pool as follows
 
head tail
| |
--------------------------------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | ...... | MAX | NULL|
--------------------------------------
At initialization time a ring is filled in with
the indexes of available buffers from 1 to MAX_NUMBER
(0 - is reserved as an invalid number).
Head pointer is set to the beginning of the ring.
Tail pointer is set to the end of the ring.
On get buffer request the index under the head poiter is extracted and given
as an index of buffer in the associated free pool. The location under the head
is filled with NULL and the head is moved to the next position (circular).
 
When a buffer is to be freed, the index of the buffer is written at the location
the tail pointing at, tail is moved to the next location (circular)
 
In order to use this set of function the user has to do the following:
- allocate an appropriate buffer pool to be managed -
- allocate a free_list_info structure.
The structure will be owned by the user;
- initialize a free list ring by calling function init_free_list_ring();
 
From that point on when the user needs a buffer from the pool, he has to
call get_index_from_free_list() function providing handle
associated with the pool as a parameter.
 
The function will return an index of the available buffer in the associated pool.
When the buffer needs to be released, function put_index_to_free_list()
is to be called to return buffer back to the pool.
 
It is caller responsibility to initialize/clean up the buffer context.
 
 
typedef struct
{
uint16 *ring;
uint16 length;
uint16 *head;
uint16 *tail;
} handle;
 
init_free_list( handle * info, ix_uint16 length);
remove_free_list( handle * info);
get_index_from_free_list(handle * info, ix_uint16 *index);
put_index_to_free_list(handle * info, ix_uint16 index);
 
* Semaphores and mutex
mutex is a binary semaphore. only two values 0/1
p operation will consume or Down operation will sleep
v operation will produce or Up operation will wakeup
 
Producer and consumer problem
 
free_buffers = 5
used_buffers = 0
 
0 1 2 3 4
+---+---+---+---+---+
| | | | | |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|
|
head, tail
 
producer code consumer code
p(free_buffers); p(used_buffers);
lock lock
buf[tail] = val; val = buf[head];
tail = (tail+1)%5 head = (head +1)%5;
unlock unlock
v(used_buffer); v(free_buffer);
 
Reader/Writer Problem:
 
Following solution gives preference to reader i.e. as long as there
are any reader, writer won't get a chance!
 
semaphore mutex = 1; // Controls access to the reader count
semaphore db = 1; // Controls access to the database
int reader_count; // The number of reading processes accessing the data
 
Reader()
{
while (TRUE) { // loop forever
down(&mutex); // gain access to reader_count
reader_count = reader_count + 1; // increment the reader_count
if (reader_count == 1)
down(&db); // if this is the first process to read the database,
// a down on db is executed to prevent access to the
// database by a writing process
up(&mutex); // allow other processes to access reader_count
read_db(); // read the database
down(&mutex); // gain access to reader_count
reader_count = reader_count - 1; // decrement reader_count
if (reader_count == 0)
up(&db); // if there are no more processes reading from the
// database, allow writing process to access the data
up(&mutex); // allow other processes to access reader_countuse_data();
// use the data read from the database (non-critical)
}
 
Writer()
{
while (TRUE) { // loop forever
create_data(); // create data to enter into database (non-critical)
down(&db); // gain access to the database
write_db(); // write information to the database
up(&db); // release exclusive access to the database
}
 
So how to fix writer starvation?
 
Reader()
{
down(read_lock)
up(read_lock)
 
down(mutext)
 
read_count ++
if (read_count == 1)
down(db)
 
up(mutext)
 
read the data base
 
down(mutext)
read_count--
if (read_count == 0)
up(db)
up(mutext)
}
 
Writer()
{
down(read_lock)
down(db)
 
write data base
 
up(db)
up(read_lock)
}
Since reader as well writer have the same priority of read_lock so this
technique does not really prefer one over the other.
 
Following algorith gives preference to writer i.e. as long there
are any writer waiting no further readers are allowed.
 
Reader:
======
 
down(mutext)
if (active_writer OR waiting_writer)
waiting_reader ++
else
//gives go ahead to self
active_reader++
up(OK-TO-READ)
up(mutext)
 
down(OK-TO_READ)
 
read...
 
down(mutext)
active_reader --
if (active_reader == 0) AND (waiting_writer)
up(OK-TO-WRITE)
waiting_writer--
active_writer++
up(mutext)
 
 
Writer:
======
 
down(mutext)
if (activer_reader OR active_writer)
waiting_writer++
else

Some maths
*Arithmatic series
An = A + (n-1)d
A is first element
An is nth element
d is difference
 
sum = n/2[2A + (n-1)d] = n/2[A + nth term]
 
An arithmetic series has first term 2000 and common difference -2.3.
Calculate the value of the first negative term of the series,
and the sum of all the positive terms.
 
Solution:
 
 
Tn = a + (n - 1)d < 0
2000 + (n - 1)(-2.3) < 0
2002.3/2.3 < n
n > 870.56
So first negative trem should be 871th term
and its value will be 2000 + (871-1)*(-2.3) = -1
 
Number of +ive terms are 870
and their summ will be (870/2)[4000 + 869(-2.3)]
 
 
 
*Geometric series
An = A * (r)^(n-1)
where r is ratio between two successive element
 
e.g. 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8
so nth element will be 1*(1/2)^(n-1)
The sum of this series is converges towards 2
(1 + .5 + .25 + .125 +....)
 
sum = A(1-r^n)/(1-r)
 
if abs(r) < 1 then r^n ->0 as n->infinity
so sum = A/(1-r)
 
* Binomial series
(a+b)^n = C(n,0)a^n + C(n,1)(a^n-1)(b) + C(n,2)(a^n-2)(b^2) +..+C(n,n)b^n
 
(x^n) - (y^n) = (x-y)(x^(n-1) + (x^(n-2))*y + ... + x*(y^(n-2)) + y^(n-1))
 
x^n -1 = (x-1) (x^(n-1) + x^(n-2) +....x^2 +x +1)

Since all terms are divisible by 7 except the last so the remainder will be 1.
 
* How to find remainder of (5^99)/8
5^99 => (4+1)^99
=>4^99 + C(99, 1) 4^98 +.....C(99, 97) 4^3 + C(99, 98) 4 + 1
Since any term in this series having 4^2 or higher is divisible by 8
so remainder is govern by C(99,98) 4 +1 =397 so remainder will be 5
 
* Taylor's series
Any function can be expressed in sum of its derivatives
 
f(x) = (Value of f(x) at x = c) +
(Value of first derivative of f(x) at x=c) * (x-c) /(FACTORIAL(1)) +
(Value of second derivative of f(x) at x=c) * (x-c)^2 /(FACTORIAL(2)) +
(Value of third derivative of f(x) at x=c) * (x-c)^3 /(FACTORIAL(3)) +
(Value of fourth derivative of f(x) at x=c) * (x-c)^4 /(FACTORIAL(4)) +
(Value of fifth derivative of f(x) at x=c) * (x-c)^5 /(FACTORIAL(5)) +
 
Where c is called center.
This series is used in finding approximate values such as squart(3.95)
 
Solution:
The function is squart(x), and we need to find its value at x = 3.95.
If we find the value of this function at c =4, it will be aproximately same as that
of c = 3.95.
 
First derivative of squart(x) = (1/2) * (1/(x)^(1/2))
Second derivative of squart(x) = (-1/4) * (1/(x)^(3/2))
Third derivative of squart(x) = (3/8) * (1/(x)^(5/2))
Fourth derivative of squart(x) = (-15/16) * (1/(x)^(7/2))
 
 
now calculate the value of these derivatives at c(4)
Val of f(x) at 4 = 2
Val of 1st derivative at 4 = 1/4
Val of 2nd derivative at 4 = -1/32
Val of 3rd derivative at 4 = 3/256
...
 
Putting these values back
2 +
1/4 * (3.95-4) +
-1/32 *(3.95-4)^2 / 2 +
3/256 *(3.95-4)^3 / 6 +
...
= 1.98746
 
Value from calculator is also 1.98746
 
Similarly squart(2) can be found. In this case, it is easy to take c = 1
using first three derivative it is 1.3984 which is close enough to 1.414(1% error).
 
* Greatest Common Divisor
GCF(8, 16, 20)
8 = 2 * 2 * 2
16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
20 = 2 * 2 * 5
------------------------
2 * 2
 
SO GCF is 4
 
* Least Common Multiple
LCM(8, 16, 20)
8 = 2 * 2 * 2
16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
20 = 2 * 2 * 5
------------------------
2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 5
So LCM is 80
where C(n,k) = factorial(n)/(factorial(n-k) * factorial(k))
 
* Prime number, is a positive number, greater than 1 who is only divisible by 1 and self.
 
bool IsPrime(int num)
{
reg int i;
 
if ((num <= 0) || (num == 1))
return 0;
for (i=2; i <num; i++) {
if (num %i == 0) //number is divisible by i
return 0;
}
return 1;
}
 
Perfect number is a positive number whoes sum of all divisor excluding itself
are equal to number itself.
E.g. 6, its factors are 1, 2, 3 and 1+2+3 = 6
 
If (2^n) -1, is a prime number then ( (2^n) -1 ) (2)^(n-1) will be perfect number.
E.g. for n =2, 2^2 -1 i.e. 3 is a prime so 3 * 2^(2-1) is a perfect number.
for n =3, 2^3 -1 i.e 7 is a prime so 7 * 2^(3-1) = 28 is a perfect number.
other perfect nums are 496, 8128
 
In order for 2^n -1 to be prime, n must be prime
for example when
n (2^n) -1 Prime number is {(2)^n -1}*{(2)^(n-1)} perfect number

So how to decide O(f) = O(g), O(f) < O(g) or O(f) > O(g)
In most of the cases if Lim n->infinity f(n) = infinity
and Lim n->infinity g(n) = infinity
and Lim n->infinity f(n)/g(n) = L, then if
0<L<infinity then O(f) = O(g)
L = 0 then O(f) < O(g)
L = infinity then O(f) > O(g)
 
Ex: O(n) = O(10n+5)
since n and (10n+5) both ->infinity as n->inf
and as n->inf, (n)/(10n +5) = 1/10

Software problem due to counter roll over
=========================================
 
Typically system has tickGet function, returning ticks laps
since system is last booted as unsigned int.
 
Say there are 64 ticks in one second so if result of tickGet
stored in unsigned int, then that counter will roll over roughly
after 111 weeks. So if code has not taken care of this roll over, then some
serious problem raised.
 
Example:
Following snippet cause problem due to this roll over
 
UINT32 take_break_after_ticks;
 
take_break_after_ticks = tickGet() + ONE_SECOND;
 
 
while(1) {
...
if (tickGet() > take_break_after_ticks) {
sleep(some_ticks);
take_break_after_ticks = tickGet() + ONE_SECOND;
}
....
}
 
The problem starts when tickGet close to rollover.
Say when take_break_after_ticks initialize, it is very close to 0xffffffff
and then tickGet roll over so tickGet will returns a smaller value for very
long time and system will not call sleep and the current task will hog the
CPU.
 
The above problem can be avoided if code is written as follows:
 
UINT32 last_tick_stamp, current_tick_stamp;
 
last_tick_stamp = tickGet();
take_break_after_ticks = last_tick_stamp + ONE_SECOND;
 
while(1)
{
...
current_tick_stamp = tickGet();
if (current_tick_stamp < last_tick_stamp) {
/* tickGet roll over */
last_tick_stamp = tickGet();
take_BREak_after_ticks = last_tick_stamp + ONE_SECOND;
} else if (current_tick_stamp > take_break_after_ticks) {
sleep();
last_tick_stamp = tickGet();
take_break_after_ticks = last_tick_stamp + ONE_SECOND;
}
...
}
 
 
* Various type of C
- K& R c: The original c (also called as traditional c).
- c89 :c based on 1989 ANSI C specification (X3.159-1989)
- c90: ANSI specification got rectified in 1990 and becomes ISO standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1990)
- c99 :c based on ANSI C group update on 1999
- GNU c: similar to c89 + lot of new features of c99 + other extension
one can choose a dialect in gcc by -std= switch
possible values are c89, c99, gnu89, iso9899:1990 (for ISO 1990) and gnu99.
gnu89 is current default. gnu99 will become the default when c99 support is complete.
One should use -pedantic (or -pedantic-errors if you want them to be errors
rather than warnings) to list all ISO con-confirmnance.
 
one can also use -ansi for ISO C89 (C90?)
 
* How to mix c and c++ code
Say c++ code like to use c fn available in user lib form
(I guess standard c lib already taken care of this!).
E.g.
// c header file greet.h
char *greet();
 
//c source file greet.c
#include "greet.h"
char *greet() { return ( (char *) "Hello" ); }
 
say compile above c file using c compiler and generates libgrret.a
 
//c++ source file mixedcode.cpp
#include greet.h"
main() { char *greeting = greet(); cout << greeting <<"\n";}
 
compile mixcode.cpp using c++ compiler and link libgreet.a
to resolve greet(). But linking phase will give error
as it will not find greet().
The reason is c++ compiler name mangling functionality.
Due to name mangle function, greet() will be internally
referenced as something else (depends on compile algorithm)
so linker could not found that mangled name in libgreet.a
 
The solution is disabling the name mangling in c++ compiler
for greet(). This can be done by as follows:
//file greet.h
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
 
char *greet();
 
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
 
The extern "C" linkage will tell c++ compiler that do not generates
mangle name for greet() as it is c function. Please note that c compiler
does not support extern "C" linkage and hence we put above under __cplusplus
flag to avoid compilation error in c compiler.
 
Please also note if one is mixing c and c++ code then use compilers that are
compatable such as they define data type int, float or pointer in the same way.
 
One disadvantage of disabling the name mangling functionality is that
perticular function can not be overloaded.
 
* include guard
To avoid including same header file multiple number of times (and cause
compiler error), each header file conditionally set a unique pre-processor
macro. E.g.,
 
File grandfather.h
#ifndef GRANDFATHER_H
#define GRANDFATHER_H
 
struct foo {
int foo_bar;
};
 
#endif
 
File father.h
#include grandfather.h
 
File child.c
#include grandfather.h
#include father.h
 
...
 
One possible isuue with it that pre-processor macro may clash with
any third-party name or any other global variable.
 
To avoid this, compilers provide non-standard directive #pragma once.
Programmers insert the "#pragma once" at the top of a header file to
this scheme to work.
Possible drawback is that compiler may not able to diffrenciate between
symbolic links of same files1
 
 
* Sorting Algorithms
 
Type Best Time Average Worst-Time Mem-Space Stability Note
Bubble sort O(n) O(n^2) O(1) y
Binary tree O(nLogn) O(nLogn) O(nLogn) O(1) y
Merge O(nLogn) O(nLogn) O(nLogn) O(n) y
Quick O(nLogn) O(nLogn) O(n^2) O(Logn) n
Heap O(nLogn) O(nLogn) O(nLogn) O(1) n
 
A sorting algo is stable if it preserve the relative position of
duplicate keys.
 
** Merge Sort:
Typical example of Divide and Conquer
 
Algorith:
// Assuming array A to be sorted between index left and right
List mergesort(left, right)
List list1, list2, result
 
if (left eq right)
put the array content in result and returns result;
 
find mid <- (left+right)/2
 
list1= mergesort(left, mid); // divide
list2= mergesort(mid+1, right); // divide
result = merge(list1, list2); // conquer
 
Common implementation pitfalls:
 
Most of the implementation take the middle by adding left with righ and
dividing by 2. This is Ok for most of cases but when very large number
of items have to sort, this scheme fails due to overflow.
Possible solutions are use bigger data type to store middle or
use left + (right-left)/2 to calculate middle.
 
Advantages:
1) Good for slow media such as tape.
2) Stable
 
Disadvantages:
1) Due to recursion, many stack frames are required(LogN base 2).
One can divide it in to more than 2 say 3 sublist to cut down the
stack requirement. Also, in case of array an additional array of
size n is required.
 
2) Merge sort runs in O(n lg n) time, no matter what the input.
This can be an advantage, but in some cases it can be a liability
(if list is already sorted).
 
3) An extra array of O(n) size is required to hold the result of
a merger. So, mergesort is not in-place algorithm.
 
Merge sort on single link list:
Initially it looks merge sort is not good candidate to be performed
on linked list as mid element is required at each step to divide the
list in two equal lists. One can move the alternate node of link
list in two lists solve the problem. Once that is done, sorting
each list individually and then merging the result will achieve the
goal. One advantage of using the linked list over array is that
no additional space (array of size n) is required in link list case.
 
Algorithm:
 
Node_t *merge_sort(Node_t *original_list)
 
Node_t *list1_head = NULL;
Node_t *list1_tail = NULL;
Node_t *list2_head = NULL;
Node_t *list2_tail = NULL;
 
if (original_list == NULL) OR (original_list->next == NULL) {
/* original list is NULL or has only single node
* In either case no further sorting is required!
*/
return original_list;
}
 
/* original list has more than one node.
* divide the orig list in two equal lists
* by alternatively adding node in two different lists.
*/
while (original_list) {
/* Add the node pointed by original_list to
* list1 at the tail/end.
*/
append(original_list, list1_head, list1_tail);
 
/* move the original_list to next node */
original_list = original_list->next;
/* Add node pointing by original list to list2 */
if (original_list) {
append(original_list, list2_head, list_tail);
}
 
}
/* Now orig list is divided in to list1 and list2
* further merge_sort these list and combine the
* result!
*/
list1_head = merge_sort(list1_head);
list2_head = merge_sort(list2_head);
 
return( merge(list1_head, list2_head) );

** Quick Sort
Based on Divide and conquer algo
 
Algorithm:
1) Choose an item from the array to be the pivot.
 
2) Partition the array such that all items less than the pivot
are to the left and all items greater than are to the right.
This will put the pivot to its proper position.
 
3) Recursively sort each partition.
 
Clearly, the performance of quicksort depend heavily on which array
item is chosen as pivot. The best case is that pivot partition the array
in two equally sized subarray at each stage. The worst case is that one
partition is empty at each stage of partition (sorted array case).
 
** Bucket sort
Sorting w/t comparison and swapping!
Time complexity O(n)
Specialized radix sort
 
Algo:
 
* Let A be an array of integers to be sorted
* Create B, a second array whose size is maximum value in A
* Put elements from A into B using value as an index into B
* Back Copy in order into A
 
Advantages: time complexity of order O(n)
Disadvantage: lots of space, problem with duplicates
 
 
* Exhausting testing is not always an option
Example: suppose one has a test a 32 bit adder
so there are (2^32) * (2^32) i.e. 16 billion * 10^9 inputs available
Assuming m/c test billion samples in one second it takes 500 years!
 
 
**** String related
0) Reverse string in place
tricky: reverse the words in a sentence
such as "The house is blue" should becomes "blue is house The"
 
First part of question can be handled by taking two pointers,
one from the start of string and then second from end, swapping
their contents and incrementing start and decrementing end pointers
as long as end_ptr > start pointer.
 
The tricky part of reversing the words in sentences can be done
by first reversing the whole sentence e.g.
"eulb si esuoh ehT" in above example and then
reversing each word separately.
 
1) finding if given pattern is present in a given text
 
Crude way of searching pattern P (size m) in text T(size n) is as follows
 
for (i=0; i<(n-m); i++) {
for (j=0; j<m; j++) {
if (P[j] != T[j+i])
break
}
if (j == m)
return i; //return the start position of pattern
}
 
// Couldn't found the pattern in text
return -1;
 
Time complexity of above is O(m*n)
 
Above algorithm is not very efficient so there are various
algorithm such as
 
Rabin-Karp (RK) - based on comparing the hash values.
The RK exploit the fact that if two strings are same
then their hash values will also be equal.
 
So, basically one compute the hash value of pattern P
and then start making substrings (with length of pattern P)
in Text T, compute their hash value and then compare from
hash value of pattern P.
 
If hash value of substring matches with that of pattern P
than chances are high that substring and pattern are same
(this happen due to collision). At this point substring and
pattern are compaired char by char if all chars match volla
we found the substring otherwise move to next substring.
There are two challenges
 
a) Keep the hash value small enough so we can store
in int or long. The solution is mod.
 
b) How to avoid lengthy calculation of hash value of each substring.
The solution is use rolling hash function in which hash value of next
substring can be derived from its predecessor.

* Bloom Filter: This will quickly test membership in a large set using
multiple hash functions into single array of bits.
False positive are possible but false negative are not.
Again elements can be added to the set but can not removed
(though counting bloom filter can solve this).
Multiple hash function can be produced following way
say f1 and f2 are two independent hash functions then
( f1(x) + i * f2(x) ) mod m where m is prime number
can be new hash function.
Check more on wikipedia for Bloom and counting Bloom functions.

* Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem
Some applications of the LCS problem include:
 
o Searching for proteins with similar DNA sequences: DNA sequences (genes) can
be represented as sequences of four letters ACGT, corresponding to the
four submolecules forming DNA. When biologists find a new sequence,
they typically want to know what other sequences it is most similar to.
One way of computing how similar two sequences are is to find the length
of their longest common subsequence.
 
o Approximate string matching like spell checkers.
 
o File comparison (used in diff, CVS, source comparer, cheater finder, plagiarism detection).
 
 
Pseudo-code shows bottom-up dynamic programming:
 
m <- LENGTH[X];
n <- LENGTH[Y];
for i <- 1 to m, do c[i,0] <-0;
for j <- 0 to n, do c[0,j] <-0;
back <- c;// backtracking array
 
for i <0 to m, do {
for j < 0 to n do {
if (x[i] = y[j]) {
c[i,j] <- c[i-1, j-1]+1;
back[i,j] <- "UP&LEFT";
}
else if (c[i-1,j] >= c[i,j-1]) {
c[i,j] <- c[i-1,j];
back[i,j] <- "UP";
}
else
c[i,j] <- c[i,j-1];
back[i,j] <- "LEFT";
}
}
return c and back
 
Getting the subsequence itself
------------------------------
 
int i<-m, j <- n,
score <- c[m,n];
string lcs=empty;
// Trace the backtracking matrix.
 
while (i >0 || j>0)
{
<B>if</B> (back[i, j] = "UP&LEFT")
{
i--;
j--;
 
lcs=X[i] + lcs;
}
else if( back[i,j] = UP )
i--;
 
else if ( back[i,j] = LEFT )
j--;
}
 
return score and lcs;
 
*** General String related problems
1. Anagram related
Find out if two strings s1 and s2 are anagram?
Approach-1: Sort out the two strings s1 and s2 (merge sort takes n log n time to sort each string) and then compare letter by letter.
 
Approach-2: Make a histogram i.e. count the frequency of each alphabet in each string and then compare the two histograms. They need to be exactly same for strings to be anagram.
 
Approach-3: Have a list of unique prime numbers (one for each character in alphabet), compute a hash using each character maps to unique prime number. If the hash for two strings is same they will be anagram.
 
2. Palindrome related
Check if string is palindrome
Find out longest palindrome in given text (hint - dynamic programming)
 
3. Is given string/pattern is substring in given text
 
4. Find out longest common sub string
 
5. Is given string/pattern is sub sequence in given text
 
Suppose s1 is the text and we need to find out if s2 is subsequence of s1
is_subsequence(char *s1, char *s2) {
 
if (*s2 == `\0`)    return 1;  //We reach to end of sub sequence!!!
 
// We have not exhausted all the characters of s2 and reach to end of text
// So, s2 can’t be sub-sequence of s1    
if (s1 == `\0`) 
        return 0;     
}
 
if (*s1 == *s2) {
// find a match so move to next character position
    return (is_subsequence(++s1, ++s2));
}
 
return (is_subsequence(++s1, s2));

**** Seven Bridges of Königsberg
Each node should have even arc except starting and ending node.
So, if starting and ending nodes are same, there should be only
on node (at the max), which can have odd number of arcs.

7. Find out if two strings are anargam
1. Keep a histogram for each string and compare them 
 
    We need to assume that character set is ANSI
 
    int histo[256];
    for (i=0; s1[i]!= ‘\0’ && s2[i] != ‘\0’; i++) {
        histo[s1[i]]++;
        histo[s2[i]]--;
    }
    if s1[i] != `\0’ or s2[i] != `\0’ then it implies that control reaches to end of the one string only => two strings of different length => two strings are not anagram
 
    Now if all member of histo array are zero then strings are anagrams
 
    for loop run for n (length of string) and there are two operation in the loop = 2n
    loop through histogram to check member is zero take n
    Total time complexity O(3n) = O(n)
    Space required by histo is n = O(n)
    We have avoided strlen to save one scan 
 
    instead of histogram use sum
    sum = 0;
    for (i=0; s1[i] != `\0` && s2[i] != `\0`; i++) {
        sum += s1[i];
        sum -= s2[i];
    }
if (s1[i] != `\0` || s2[i] != `\0’`)
    s1 and s2 are not anagram;
if sum == 0 => anagram (This may give false positive for example cf and bg both have same sum but they are not anagram)
else these strings are not anagram
 
8. Find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers (containing at least one positive number) which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.
 
The linear time algorithm was found by Jay Kadane of Carnegie-Mellon University (Bentley 1984) http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Kadane%27s_Algorithm
 
prevMaxSum = minus infinity
prevMaxStart = prevMaxEnd = 1 //start and end position of previous sequence
 
currMaxSum = 0
curMaxStart = curMaxEnd = 1 //start and end position of current sequence
 
for curMaxEnd := 1 to N
 
    curMaxSum += A[curMaxEnd]
 
    if (curMaxSum > prevMaxSum) {
        prevMaxSum = curMaxSum
        prevMaxStart = curMaxStart
        prevMaxEnd = curMaxEnd
    }
 
    if (curMaxSum < 0) {
        //if curMaxSum dropped below 0
        curMaxSum = 0
        curMaxStart = curMaxEnd+1
    }
 
* How gdb or debugger implements breakpoints
With the support of Hardware. CPU has few internal registers which are dedicated for this purpose. User write the address where (s)he likes to set the breakpoints in these registers. CPU compare the value in these reg with that of PC and raise the exception which debugger catch.
Second approach is software way. In this approach debugger replaced the instruction (in text segment) at specific location by trap. when control come to at this location where original instruction was replaced by “trap” it caused an exception which can be further catch by debugger. 
Linux use ptrace system call to track a process. Basically, debugger fork a child process which will execute the ptrace system call and then exec the program to be traced. The parent process (the debugger) execute the wait system call and take action based on status returns by wait.
 
 
*  C language characteristics and their impact on security
 
Undefined Behavior: The ISO/IEC 9899:2011 standard does not impose any requirements such as 
    1. dereferencing the NULL pointer
        - Consider the following code
 





void contains_null_check(int *P) {
  int dead = *P;  //dead code
 
  if (P == 0) 	
 	return;  
  *P = 4;
}
 
There are two possibilities
Compiler run the “dead code optimization”  and remove it. In that case function will indeed check for NULL. However if compiler see that p is being dereferenced so check for null is redundant so it can optimized the null check and that case we will notice undefined behaviour when “*p=4”.

    2. Write in array after or before valid index
    3. Write in string literals
    4. Signed int overflow
 
Unspecified Behaviour: The standards have more than one possibilities but imposes no requirement on which is chosen in any instance.
    - The order in which arg to a function are evaluated.
 
Implementation defined  Behaviour: Unspecified behaviour where implementation document how the choice is made.
    - The propagation of the higher-order bit when signed integer is shifted right.

some interesting interview question related with ip world
* Name few private ip address range or name few ip addresses which router never see
    10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255,
    Number of addresses: 16 *1024 * 1024 order of 16 million
    CIDR 10.0.0.0/8

    172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    Number of addresses: 1024 * 1024 i.e. order of one million
    CIDR 172.16.0.0/12

    192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
    Number of addresses: 16 * 1024 i.e. order of 64 thousand

* How to convert dotted ip string to number and vice versa
    Say ip number is 192.168.2.3
    so think of it four octets delimited by dot
    Remove the dot and think of it an integer stored in four octets
    Now starting left, first octet position value is 256*256*256
    second octet from left has a position value of 256*256
    third octet has position value of 256
    and fourth octet has 1 as position value
    i.e. 192*256*256*256 + 168*256*256 + 2*256 +3

    The c strtok lib call can be used to get the various octets

    Simple program to convert could be as follows

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("%s <dot notation ip address>\n", argv[0]);
        return;
    }

    int num = 0;
    char *token;

    token = strtok(argv[1], ".");
    while (token) {
        printf("current token: (%s) number is (%d)\n", token, num);
        num = (num<<8) + atoi(token);
        ("new number is (%d) ", num);
        token = strtok(NULL, ".");
        if (token) printf("token is (%s)\n", token);
    }

    printf("Final number is (%d) (0x%x)\n", num, num);
    printf("final num after ntohl is (%d) (0x%x)\n", ntohl(num), ntohl(num));
}

* How to convert a ip number (in integer form) to dot separated notation

* How to find out the smallest and largest ip address for given CIDR
 Say given CIDR address is 192.168.2.3/24
  i.e. first 24 bits in ip address will
  be fixed and last (32-24) bits can vary from all zeroes to all ones

  So, one approach could be find out a mask whose first 24 bits are 1 and
  remaining (32-24) bits are 0. Apply(Bit AND) such mask on the integer corresponding to
  ip address to get the minimum.

  To get the maximum, find out a mask whose first 24 bits are 0 and last (32-24)
  bits are 1. Add this mask in minimum ip address to get the maximum ip address
  in the CIDR.

  (2 ^ (32-24)) - 1 gives a number where first 24 bits are 0 and last (32-24) bits are all 1
  Taking a negation on such number will a mask first 24 bits are 1 and last
  (32-24) bits are zero. So this mask could be used to find out the minimum when
  AND with ip number.

  Once we have minimum and maximum integer number they can be converted back to
  dot notation.
